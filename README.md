# Text-Classification
Identifying Tweets Pertaining to Public Emergencies Using NLP (and other models on text-classification and sentiment analysis)

There are two versions of solutions to the 'Real_or_Not' text classification problem. 
- Version 9 performs the tweet categorization using ML constructs (Feature Engineering, followed by implementing Support Vector Machines and Ensemble Methods).
- Version 10 performs the categorizations using (Dense) Neural Networks and RNN (Recurring Neural Networks)

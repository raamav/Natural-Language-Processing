# Text-Classification and Sentiment-Analysis
This repository has a set of problems in the field of text classification/sentiment analysis. 
Identifying Tweets Pertaining to Public Emergencies Using NLP (and other models on text-classification and sentiment analysis)

## Dataset: 'Real_or_Not
The objective is to identify Tweets Pertaining to Public Emergencies given the contents of the Tweet and the location from which the Tweet originated. 

There are two versions of solutions to the 'Real_or_Not' text classification problem. 
- Version 9 performs the tweet categorization using ML constructs (Feature Engineering, followed by implementing Support Vector Machines and Ensemble Methods).
- Version 10 performs the categorizations using (Dense) Neural Networks and RNN (Recurring Neural Networks)

## Dataset: IMDB Movie Reviews
This is one of the best-known starter datasets in ML. The objective is to correctively identify the sentiment (whether the positive or negative) of full-length movie reviews posted on IMDB.com. 
A set of different approaches have been attempted, right from the classical ML-based (Logistic, SVM, Ensemble) approaches to using Deep Learning frameworks (like ANN and RNN)
